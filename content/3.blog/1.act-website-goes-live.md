# ACT Website Goes Live

We are excited to announce the launch of the official MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) website! This new platform serves as the central hub for all ACT-related resources, documentation, and tools.

## What is ACT?

Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) is a revolutionary security and risk assessment framework developed by MITRE's Cyber Solutions Innovation Center. Unlike traditional compliance-focused approaches, ACT emphasizes **risk-based decision making** at the capability level, helping organizations answer the critical question: "Are we secure enough to accomplish our mission?"

## What You'll Find Here

Our new website provides comprehensive resources for security professionals, assessment teams, and organizational leaders:

## Key Features of the ACT Framework

The ACT methodology offers several advantages over traditional security assessment approaches:

- **Risk-Driven Focus**: Prioritizes real risks to mission and business operations over checkbox compliance
- **Capability-Oriented**: Emphasizes what systems need to achieve rather than prescriptive implementation requirements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Considers all available risk information sources, not just control compliance status
- **Actionable Insights**: Delivers findings and recommendations that directly support executive decision-making

## Getting Started with ACT

Whether you're an assessment team member, authorization official, system owner, or security professional, this website provides the resources you need to understand and implement ACT:

1. **Explore the Documentation**: Start with our [Introduction to ACT](/docs) to understand the framework's core principles
2. **Download Resources**: Visit our [Artifacts page](/docs/artifacts) to access templates and assessment tools
3. **Connect with Us**: Contact the ACT team at [act@mitre.org](mailto:act@mitre.org) for support and guidance

## Looking Ahead

This website launch represents an important milestone in making ACT more accessible to the security community. We're committed to continuously improving and expanding these resources based on your feedback and evolving security challenges.

As threats evolve and systems become more complex, the need for risk-based security assessment becomes increasingly critical. ACT provides a proven methodology to help organizations move beyond compliance checkboxes to achieve meaningful security outcomes.

## Join the ACT Community

We invite you to explore the website, download our resources, and join us in advancing risk-based security assessment. Your feedback and experiences with ACT are invaluable in helping us refine and improve the framework.
