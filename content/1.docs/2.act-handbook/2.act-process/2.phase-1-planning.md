# Phase 1: Planning

Phase 1 of the ACT process focuses on planning and preparation for the assessment. This phase is critical for ensuring that the assessment is well-structured, properly scoped, and aligned with organizational objectives.

![Workflow - Phase 1](/images/act-handbook/Workflow - Phase 1.png)

## Key Activities

The Planning phase includes the following key activities:

1. **Start Assessment** - Initiate the assessment process
2. **Conduct Preliminary Discussion** - Initial stakeholder meetings
3. **Review Tier 1 Artifacts** - Examine key system documentation
4. **Develop Assessment Plan** - Create detailed testing approach
5. **Conduct Review Meetings** - Review plan with stakeholders

## Start Assessment

The assessment begins with formal initiation by the Assessment Team Lead. This includes:

- Identifying the Assessment Team Lead (ATL)
- Establishing the assessment type (Security Assessment, Risk Assessment, or both)
- Identifying key stakeholders
- Defining initial timeline milestones
- Setting up collaborative workspaces for the assessment team

## Conduct Preliminary Discussion

::alert{type="info"}
**Best Practice**: Schedule the preliminary discussion at least two weeks before planned assessment activities to allow sufficient time for document collection and review.
::

Early in the planning phase, the Assessment Team Lead conducts a preliminary discussion with key stakeholders, including:

- System Owner
- Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
- Authorizing Official (AO) or representative
- Other key system stakeholders

During this discussion, the team:
- Introduces the ACT methodology
- Gathers initial information about the system
- Identifies key documentation sources
- Discusses the assessment scope and boundary
- Establishes expectations for stakeholder involvement
- Sets preliminary timelines

## Review Tier 1 Artifacts

The assessment team reviews key Tier 1 artifacts, including:

| Artifact | Review Purpose |
|---|---|
| System Security Plan (SSP) | Understand system architecture, boundaries, and security controls |
| Previous Assessment Reports | Identify known issues and remediation status |
| Architecture Diagrams | Visualize system components and interactions |
| Authorization Boundary | Clarify scope and responsibility boundaries |
| Data Flow Diagrams | Understand information movement and protection needs |
| Risk Register | Identify known risks and current mitigations |

This review helps the team understand:

## Develop Assessment Plan

::alert{type="warning"}
**Important Consideration**: The assessment plan should be tailored to the system's complexity, criticality, and available resources. One size does not fit all.
::

Based on the preliminary discussion and document review, the team develops a detailed assessment plan that includes:

- Assessment scope and objectives
- Assessment boundary definition
- Testing methodologies and approaches
- Timeline and milestones
- Required resources
- Stakeholder responsibilities
- Reporting requirements

### Assessment Boundary

A clear definition of the assessment boundary is crucial for effective planning. The assessment boundary may differ from the authorization boundary.

## Conduct Assessment Plan Review Meeting

Once the assessment plan is drafted, the Assessment Team Lead conducts a review meeting with key stakeholders to:

- Present the draft assessment plan
- Clarify any questions about scope or methodology
- Address stakeholder concerns
- Finalize assessment activities and timeline
- Secure stakeholder buy-in for the assessment approach

::alert{type="success"}
**Success Criteria**: A successful assessment plan review meeting results in documented agreement on scope, approach, timeline, and stakeholder responsibilities.

## Conduct Readiness Review Meeting

Before beginning the assessment phase, the team conducts a readiness review to ensure:

| Category | Readiness Criteria |
|---|---|
| Documentation | All necessary documentation is available and up-to-date |
| Environment | Technical environments are ready for testing activities |
| Access | Assessment team has necessary access to systems and personnel |
| Tools | Testing tools are appropriate and prepared |
| Stakeholders | Key personnel are available during the assessment period |

## Assessment Team Preparation

The Assessment Team Lead ensures that all team members:

- Understand the assessment scope and objectives
- Are familiar with the system under assessment
- Have appropriate tools and access
- Understand their roles and responsibilities
- Are prepared to execute their assigned assessment activities

## Deliver Updated Assessment Plan

After incorporating feedback from all review meetings, the Assessment Team Lead delivers the final assessment plan to stakeholders, marking the transition to Phase 2: Assessment.
