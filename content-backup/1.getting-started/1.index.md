description: An overview of the Adaptive Capabilities Testing framework for risk-based security assessment
---

Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) is a security and risk assessment framework that facilitates and encourages risk-based decision-making. ACT implements a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable process that enables organizations to meet the objectives of the _NIST Risk Management Framework_ (RMF) and other risk-oriented processes.

::note
ACT can provide the primary input to the Authorization to Operate (ATO) process, superseding compliance-oriented assessments such as the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) process.

## What is ACT?

ACT revolutionizes security assessment by shifting focus from technical compliance checklists to understanding and communicating real risks to mission and business operations. Instead of asking "Are we compliant?", ACT asks "Are we secure enough to accomplish our mission?"

## Core Principles

Compared to compliance-oriented assessments, ACT is:

  ::card{title="Risk-Driven" icon="i-heroicons-chart-bar"}
    Focuses on risk identification and analysis at the capability level rather than technical compliance
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Capability-Oriented" icon="i-heroicons-cube"}
    Emphasizes system objectives over specific implementation requirements
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Comprehensive" icon="i-heroicons-document-chart-bar"}
    Considers all available risk data sources, not just control compliance status

  ::card{title="Actionable" icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Provides context and recommendations that help determine what should be done

## The ACT Process

The ACT methodology follows a systematic three-phase approach:

::steps{level="3"}

### Phase 1: Planning
Establish scope, develop methodology, create test plan, and prepare the assessment team

### Phase 2: Assessment
Execute security testing and risk analysis activities according to the assessment plan

### Phase 3: Reporting
Document findings, develop actionable recommendations, and present results to stakeholders

## Benefits of Using ACT

- **Enhanced Risk Visibility**: Provides leadership with a clearer picture of real security risks
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Helps focus security investments on highest-risk areas
- **Meaningful Compliance**: Evaluates how well compliance activities actually reduce risk
- **Improved Decision Making**: Delivers findings that are immediately useful for executives
