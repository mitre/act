## About ACT

The MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) framework moves security assessment beyond traditional compliance-focused approaches to a capability-focused, risk-based methodology that provides actionable insights for decision-makers.

### Key Principles

- **Risk-driven** rather than compliance-driven
- **Capability-oriented** rather than control-oriented
- **Multiple risk information sources** beyond just control compliance
- **Understandable and actionable** for leadership decision-making

## Development

### Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

The fastest way to get started is using GitHub Codespaces:

1. Click the green "Code" button above
2. Select "Create codespace on main"
3. Wait for the environment to build (~2-3 minutes)
4. The development server will start automatically

### Local Development

Requirements:
- Node.js 22.x
- pnpm 10.7.0 or higher

```bash
# Install pnpm if you haven't already
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.7.0 --activate

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The development server will start at http://localhost:3000

### VS Code Dev Containers
