# MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT)™

## Transform Your Cybersecurity Assessment Approach

MITRE ACT™ is a flexible, efficient, and customizable security and risk assessment framework that empowers organizations to make informed, risk-based decisions about their cybersecurity posture. Unlike traditional compliance-driven assessments, ACT focuses on understanding the actual risks to your mission-critical capabilities, helping you allocate resources where they matter most.

## What is MITRE ACT?

MITRE Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) is a capabilities-focused assessment framework that encourages and drives risk-based decision-making by considering all available Risk Information Sources (RIS). The findings generated by compliance-focused assessments are valuable, but when considered in isolation they lack the context necessary to determine how they actually impact the organization. MITRE ACT helps organizations move beyond checkbox compliance to understand what their security findings actually mean in the context of their mission objectives... and whether or not compliance is the "right" choice.

### The ACT Difference

While traditional assessments, such as Security Control Assessments (SCAs), generate valuable lists of low-level technical findings, ACT **transforms** this data into **actionable intelligence**:

- **Risk-driven rather than compliance-driven**: ACT focuses on risk identification and analysis at the capability level, de-emphasizing technical findings and compliance checkboxes
- **Capability-oriented rather than control-oriented**: Capabilities state objectives, while controls state specific implementation requirements that might help meet those objectives
- **Based on multiple Risk Information Sources**: ACT considers **all available risk data** at the time of assessment, not just current compliance status
- **More understandable and actionable**: ACT adds context, brings conversation to a higher level, and helps readers determine **what should be done**

## Why ACT Matters

### The Problem with Traditional Assessments

Many federal and commercial cybersecurity programs suffer from similar weaknesses:

1. Low-level technical findings are handed directly to less-technical decision makers
2. Decision-makers lack an appropriate framework for understanding the actual risks
3. Without risk context, "close all findings" becomes the default reaction - **regardless of cost or impact to the organization**
4. Organizations blindly comply with standards rather than make risk-based decisions
5. **Money and resources are wasted on inappropriate compliance efforts**

### The ACT Solution

ACT addresses these challenges by:

- Implementing a risk-based decision-making framework that is tailored to the needs of your specific organization, while maintaining compatibility and comparability with other organization's ACT implementations
- Providing context that explains what technical findings mean to your mission
- Empowering decision-makers to understand and choose when and how to comply, and when to accept risk
- Focusing resources on the highest-impact security improvements
- Supporting efficient, cost-effective, and repeatable risk-based assessment processes

## How ACT Works

### Security Capabilities Focus

ACT organizes security objectives into high-level Capabilities such as:

- **CRED**: Manage Credentials and Authentication
- **PRIV**: Manage Privileges and Accounts
- **VULN**: Vulnerability (Patch) Management
- **BEHAVE**: Manage Behavioral Expectations

Each Capability (and their multiple Sub-Capabilities) reflects the high-level _why_ a system needs to be secure, rather than the low-level _how_ it complies.

These Capabilities are mapped to the various compliance standards that your organization cares about, creating a common language that both technical teams and executives can understand. Examples of mapped compliance standards might include:
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 security controls
- Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memos
- Internal policies and directives
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements
- Financial laws and regulations
- Industry best practices

### Comprehensive Risk Analysis

ACT integrates your multiple available Risk Information Sources (RIS) to provide a complete picture:

- Risk Assessment Reports (RARs)
- Security Control Assessment (SCA) Reports
- Security Assessment Reports (SARs)
- Penetration Testing Results
- Vulnerability Assessments
- Other Audit Findings
- Incident Response Evaluations
- Continuous Monitoring Data
- Real-time Sensor Data
- News and World Events
- And more...

### Risk-Based Decision Framework

ACT applies all RIS to each other to determine three types of actionable risks:

1. **Inherent Risks**: Direct risks resulting from unmitigated findings
2. **Residual Risks**: Indirect risks that remain after mitigation
3. **Inherited Risks**: Risks received from interconnected systems

## ACT in Practice

### Assessment Types

ACT implements two complementary assessment types:

**Risk Assessment**

- Analyzes all available risk information sources
- Identifies mission-impact risks
- Provides context for decision-making
- Enables risk-based ATO decisions

**Security Assessment**

- Determines compliance with NIST SP 800-53 security controls - essentially a streamlined traditional SCA process
- Identifies technical, operational, and management findings
- Provides one of your organization's multiple sources of risk information


### Flexible Implementation

ACT adapts to your needs with:

- Multiple levels (1 - 4) of assessment rigor
- Scalable scope options (comprehensive, tailored, application-only, infrastructure-only)
- Support for various system types including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments
