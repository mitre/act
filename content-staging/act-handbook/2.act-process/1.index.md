# ACT Process Overview

The ACT process provides a comprehensive approach to security and risk assessment. It consists of three main phases:

1. **Planning**
2. **Assessment**
3. **Reporting**

## Process Flow

The ACT process follows a logical progression from initial planning through assessment and reporting, with each phase building on the previous one.

### Phase 1: Planning

The planning phase establishes the foundation for the entire assessment. Key activities include:

- Initiating the assessment
- Conducting preliminary discussions with stakeholders
- Reviewing system documentation
- Defining the assessment boundary
- Developing the assessment plan
- Conducting assessment plan review

### Phase 2: Assessment

The assessment phase involves the actual evaluation of system capabilities and associated risks. There are two parallel tracks:

#### Security Assessment Track

- Performing security testing
- Analyzing test results
- Identifying vulnerabilities
- Generating preliminary findings

::

#### Risk Assessment Track

- Identifying risks
- Analyzing risk impacts
- Evaluating risk likelihood
- Determining risk levels

### Phase 3: Reporting

The reporting phase consolidates findings into actionable information for decision-makers. Activities include:

- Preparing the draft report
- Conducting stakeholder review
- Finalizing the report
- Presenting findings to stakeholders

## Process Improvement

After completing an assessment, the ACT process includes a follow-up phase for continuous improvement:

- Reviewing lessons learned
- Updating assessment methodologies
- Refining templates and tools
- Sharing best practices
