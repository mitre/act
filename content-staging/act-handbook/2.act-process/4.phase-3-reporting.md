# Phase 3: Reporting

Phase 3 of the ACT process focuses on consolidating assessment findings into actionable reports that support risk-based decision making.

## Reporting Process Overview

The reporting phase transforms assessment data into clear, actionable information for stakeholders. This phase includes:

1. Developing draft assessment reports and supporting files
2. Reviewing reports with stakeholders
3. Updating reports based on feedback
4. Finalizing and delivering the assessment package

## Develop Assessment Report, Findings File, and Risks File

### Assessment Report Development

The Assessment Team Lead, with support from technical writers and the assessment team, develops a comprehensive report that includes:

- Executive summary
- System description
- Assessment methodology
- Key findings and their impact
- Risk analysis
- Recommendations
- Appendices with detailed technical information

### Findings File

The findings file details specific security issues identified during the assessment, including:

- Finding ID and title
- Description of the finding
- Technical details
- Evidence collected
- Control mapping (if applicable)
- Recommended remediation steps
- Finding severity

### Risks File

The risks file documents system risks identified through the risk assessment process, including:

- Risk ID and title
- Risk statement
- Risk analysis (impact and likelihood)
- Risk rating
- Affected capabilities
- Recommended risk response
- Risk ownership

## Conduct Assessment Report Review Meeting

After developing draft reports, the Assessment Team Lead conducts a review meeting with stakeholders to:

- Present key findings and risks
- Explain assessment methodology
- Discuss technical details of significant findings
- Review risk ratings and their justification
- Gather feedback on report accuracy and completeness
- Clarify any misunderstandings
- Discuss potential remediation strategies

## Update Assessment Report, Findings File, and Risks File

Based on feedback from the review meeting, the assessment team:

- Addresses stakeholder comments and questions
- Corrects any factual errors
- Clarifies technical details as needed
- Updates risk ratings if warranted
- Enhances remediation recommendations
- Finalizes the report format and presentation

## Upload Assessment Report, Findings File, and Risks File

Once the reports are updated, the Assessment Team Lead:

- Uploads all documentation to the designated storage location
- Ensures proper access controls for sensitive information
- Verifies that all required documents are included
- Confirms document versioning is correct

## Create and Deliver Final Package

The final assessment package typically includes:

- Final assessment report
- Executive briefing slides
- Findings file
- Risks file
- Supporting evidence and technical details
- Remediation roadmap (optional)

This package is delivered to key stakeholders, including:

- System Owner
- Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
- Authorizing Official (AO)
- Security Operations team
- Development/maintenance team

## Reporting Best Practices

Effective ACT reporting should:

- Focus on business impact rather than technical details alone
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- Avoid jargon and explain technical concepts clearly
- Prioritize findings based on risk, not just technical severity
- Connect findings to mission impact
- Present information in multiple formats for different audiences
- Include both executive summaries and detailed technical appendices

## Next Steps

After delivering the final assessment package, the assessment team should:

- Schedule a final briefing with key stakeholders
- Provide clarification on findings as needed
- Support initial remediation planning
- Transfer knowledge to system teams
- Gather feedback for process improvement
