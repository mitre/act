# Phase 2: Assessment

Phase 2 of the ACT process involves conducting the actual assessment activities based on the plan developed in Phase 1. This phase has two parallel tracks:

1. Security Assessment
2. Risk Assessment

## Security Assessment Track

The Security Assessment focuses on evaluating security controls and identifying vulnerabilities within the system.

## Risk Assessment Track

The Risk Assessment track identifies, analyzes, and evaluates risks associated with the system.

## Assessment Activities

During Phase 2, the assessment team:

1. Executes the assessment plan
2. Collects evidence through testing, interviews, and documentation review
3. Analyzes findings
4. Identifies vulnerabilities and risks
5. Documents preliminary findings
6. Conducts regular team sync meetings
7. Updates stakeholders on progress
8. Prepares for the reporting phase

## Assessment Completion

The assessment phase is complete when:
