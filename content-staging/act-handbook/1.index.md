::

MITRE's Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) implements a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable process that enables organizations to meet the objectives of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and other risk-oriented processes.

::note
ACT can provide the primary input to the Authorization to Operate (ATO) process, superseding compliance-oriented assessments such as the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) process.
::

## Key Advantages

Compared to compliance-oriented assessments, ACT offers several key advantages:

::card-group
  ::card{title="Risk-Driven" icon="i-heroicons-chart-bar" color="primary"}
    Focuses on risk identification and analysis at the capability level rather than technical compliance
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Capability-Oriented" icon="i-heroicons-cube" color="blue"}
    Emphasizes system capabilities and objectives rather than specific implementation requirements
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Multiple Data Sources" icon="i-heroicons-document-duplicate" color="indigo"}
    Considers all available risk data, not just current control compliance status
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Actionable Insights" icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb" color="amber"}
    Provides context and helps determine what should be done to address identified risks
