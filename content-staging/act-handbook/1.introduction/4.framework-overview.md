# Overview of ACT Framework and Methodology

The Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT) framework provides a structured approach to security and risk assessment that emphasizes risk-based decision making.

## Core Principles

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-puzzle-piece" color="primary"}
ACT is built on several core principles that differentiate it from traditional compliance-oriented assessment approaches.
::

::card-group
::card{title="Risk-Driven Focus" icon="i-heroicons-adjustments-horizontal"}
ACT prioritizes identifying and understanding risks at the capability level rather than focusing solely on technical compliance.
::

::card{title="Capability-Oriented" icon="i-heroicons-cube-transparent"}
Instead of focusing on individual controls, ACT considers capabilities - the functional objectives a system must achieve to fulfill its mission.
::

::card{title="Multiple Risk Information Sources" icon="i-heroicons-document-duplicate"}
ACT draws from various sources of risk data, not just control compliance.
::

::card{title="Actionable Insights" icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
ACT produces assessments that are more understandable and actionable for decision-makers.

## Assessment Process

The ACT assessment process consists of three main phases:

Planning involves understanding the system, defining the assessment scope, and developing a detailed assessment plan. Key activities include:

- Initial discussions with stakeholders
- Review of existing documentation
- Defining the assessment boundary
- Determining testing methodologies
- Creating the assessment plan

::
::

::accordion-item{label="Phase 2: Assessment"}
The assessment phase involves the actual evaluation of system capabilities and associated risks. This includes:

- Security assessment activities (testing, interviews, documentation review)
- Risk assessment activities (risk identification, analysis, and evaluation)
- Data collection and analysis
- Preliminary findings development

::accordion-item{label="Phase 3: Reporting"}
The reporting phase consolidates findings into actionable information. This includes:

- Draft report development
- Stakeholder review
- Report finalization
- Out-briefing to key stakeholders
- Recommendations for risk mitigation

## Key Differentiators

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-check-badge" color="green"}
The ACT framework differs from traditional approaches in several important ways.
::

::steps{level="3"}

### Focus on Capabilities

ACT focuses on capabilities rather than individual controls, providing a more holistic view of system security.

### Risk-Based Assessment

ACT emphasizes risk over compliance, helping organizations make better-informed decisions about security investments.

### Flexible Implementation

ACT can be tailored to different organizational contexts and integrated with existing security processes.

### Multiple Risk Information Sources

ACT considers various sources of risk information, providing a more comprehensive assessment.

### Clear Communication

ACT promotes clear communication about security risks to all stakeholders, including technical and non-technical audiences.

::note
The ACT framework is designed to be adaptable to various organizational contexts and regulatory requirements while maintaining its core risk-focused principles.
