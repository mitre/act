# How to Use This Handbook

This handbook details the Security Assessment process in detail and notes where there are deviations for the separate Risk Assessment process.

## Assessment Types

::card-group
  ::card{title="Security Assessment" icon="i-heroicons-shield-check" color="primary"}
    Focuses on evaluating the security controls and implementation of security measures
  ::
  
  ::card{title="Risk Assessment" icon="i-heroicons-chart-bar" color="orange"}
    Evaluates the level of risk associated with the system and its operations
  ::

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-information-circle" color="blue"}
Usually, if a Security Assessment is being conducted, then a Risk Assessment will also be conducted, in which case the entirety of this Handbook applies. If _only_ a Risk Assessment is being performed, then only certain portions of the Handbook apply.

## For Risk Assessment Only

When conducting a Risk Assessment (either stand-alone or in conjunction with a Security Assessment), the Risk Assessment Lead should focus on the following sections:
