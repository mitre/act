## Implementation Notes

To add downloadable files to your Nuxt Content site:

1. Place files in the `public/downloads/` directory
2. Reference them with absolute paths starting with `/downloads/`
3. **Important**: Always add `target="_blank"` or `target="_top"` to file links
   - Without this, Vue Router will intercept the link and show a "No match found" warning
   - This is because Nuxt Content uses `NuxtLink` for all internal links by default
4. Add the `download` attribute to force download instead of viewing

### Why target="_blank" is Required

Nuxt Content treats all markdown links as internal navigation by default. To link to static files:
- Use `{target="_blank"}` for new tab
- Use `{target="_top"}` for same tab
- MDC components (::card, ::button) handle this automatically with the `:to` prop
